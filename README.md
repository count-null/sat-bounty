# sat-bounty
A self-hosted audience polling engine powered by Bitcoin

MVP is something like [Bitcoin Audible's vote page](https://bitcoinaudible.com/vote/)

A WordPress integration using BTCpayserver plugin would probably get the most action.

Admin sets up the bounties
Anons boost their favorite bounty
Admin delivers the bounty to the world.
Admin "Claims" sats.

In reality. The admin has the sats as soon as they're donated. More of a UI thing.

Allows organizations to get high signal information about what thier audience wants.

Vote with your sats
